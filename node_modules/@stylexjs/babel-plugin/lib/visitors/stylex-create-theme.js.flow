/// 2. This handles local constants automatically.
/// 4. It uses the `stylexCreateTheme` from `@stylexjs/shared` to transform the JS
///    object and to get a list of injected styles.
/// 5. It converts the resulting Object back into an AST and replaces the call with it.
/// 6. It also inserts `stylex.inject` calls above the current statement as needed.
